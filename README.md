# MY-DEV-SITE-3

This is my third portfolio site. I wanted to present my projects in a story-like way, and in a professional way. This
website is already deployed and can be found at :point_right: <https://drzymala.site/> which succeeded [rojberr/my-dev-site-2](https://github.com/rojberr/my-dev-site-2) :feelsgood:

## Performance tests
